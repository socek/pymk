pymk
================================

``pymk`` is a program that provides the sam functionality that ``GNU make`` does,
but the ``makefile`` (``mkfile.py``) is a python script. Code of ``mkfile.py``
is clean, and it can do more things then ``makefile`` (like check all files from
all folders and subfolders with specific name).
